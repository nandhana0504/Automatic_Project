# Automatic Cephalometric Landmark Detection

This project implements an automatic cephalometric landmark detection system
using deep learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `src/` : Source code for training, evaluation, and prediction
- `requirements.txt` : Required Python dependencies
- `.gitignore` : Excludes datasets, outputs, and model files

## Note on Dataset and Outputs
Due to repository size constraints, datasets, trained models, and full output
files are not included in this repository.  
Sample outputs can be shared upon request.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the model:


python src/train.py

3. Run prediction:


python src/predict.py
